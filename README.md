[SimVP video prediction](https://github.com/chengtan9907/SimVPv2) using [ONNX's Wasm runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/main/js/web). You can use the notebook linked below to train your own video prediction model that runs in "real-time" in the browser. SimVP is really impressive and surprisingly performant - see the results [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12509).
